I feel horrible.
I have a bad relationship with my parents.
I would never do such a thing.
There are times when I feel anxious.
I am never fully content.
Yes, I am positive.
Great things never happens to me.
Everything is horrible.
Now is a really bad time.
This is the first day in the rest of my life.
Let's change the topic.
Then I run around in circles.
I have problems opening doors.
My cat is not friendly towards me.
You are not very friendly.
How will this help me?
Will you help me?
What shall I do?
I sometimes bite the hand that feeds me.
Every other thursday.
I feel great when going for a run.
Now I feel terrible.
Can anybody help me?
How are you really?
They all know about me.
You don't know me.
My parrot knows me.
My brother knows me.
I have a talkative parrot.
I have an inqusitive parrot.
I have parents that maybe knows me.
I have a very friendly cat.
I have a loyal dog.
The weather is a bit gray.
The next thing I want to do is to go for a walk.
And then I want to jump around for a bit.
See you later alligator.
In a while crocodile.
