# Eliza vs Niall

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/xyproto/strife.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/xyproto/strife) [![License](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg?style=flat)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xyproto/strife/master/LICENSE) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/xyproto/strife)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/xyproto/strife)

Niall, a pretty limited, but receptive chatbot, seeks therapy from Eliza, the old and traditional theraputic chatbot.

Weirdness ensues.

There is no purpose to this apart from seeing what happens.

Requires Go 1.11 or later.

## Usage

Be in the same directory as `niall.txt`, or supply training data on stdin, then:

    ./strife

Or supply the desired number of output lines:

    ./strife 10

## Installation

Development version:

    go get -u github.com/xyproto/strife
